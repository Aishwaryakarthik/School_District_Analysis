# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact and perform the same analysis we did in our module. The metrics that we want to analyze our data include: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## summary

When assessing school summaries and performing schools, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools. Thomas High School ranked second place in the top five performing schools with a 91% overall passing. After replacing both math and reading scores, Thomas High School was taken out of the top five category since they now display a 65% overall passing. On the plus side, these changes did not place Thomas High School among the bottom five performing schools. Those ranks remained the same. Per the revised School Summary, Thomas High School now ranks 8th place among 15 high schools in the district.

Another plus side from this data replacement is that it did not change the math and reading scores by grade. Granted, both the average math and reading score summaries were stratisfied by school and grade level. As shown above, the summary tables display "NaN" for ninth grade at Thomas High School whereas the remaining data remained intact.

When reviewing the School Spending summary, this data change did not impact the spending ranges for either the average math scores or average reading scores. However, this data change did impact the spending ranges for passing percentages. According to the summary above, there was a 6% decrease in % passing math, a 7% decrease in % passing reading, and a 6% decrease in % overall passing in the $630-644 spending range.

When reviewing the School Size summary, removing the ninth grade scores did not affect the average math and reading scores, but it did affect the passing percentages for medium-sized schools (1,000-2,000). In this category, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing dropped 6% each. Before the data change, the School Size summary showed that medium-sized school had a high performance (91% overall passing) compared to small (90% overall passing) and large schools (58% overall passing). Given the data change, medium size school are the second in performance (85% overall passing).
